Program solves a problem in numerical computation. It generates four lists of positive integers. List A contains 20 elements. List B has 50, list C 250, and list D 1000.It uses a linear congruential method to generate the four lists. Each integer is between 1 and 10,000. Each list is divided into two sublists,each sub-list may differ in length,in such a way that the differences of the sums of the numbers in the two sublists is minimum.
